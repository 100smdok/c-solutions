## Information
My solutions aim to be as complete as possible with little ambiguity or
cluttering. The complete exercise questions will also be provided, and the
solutions will be compiled as directed from the book.

All testing was done on a x86_64 Linux system running GCC 7.2.0 or greater. The
compiler has been set to run the C89 or C99 standard unless otherwise noted.
